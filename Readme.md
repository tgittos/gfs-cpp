Game from Scratch - C++ Edition
================================

[Game from Scratch](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Game-From-Scratch-CPP-Edition.aspx) is a tutorial in creating a Pong clone (called "Pang") using SFML and C++.

This repository is for the code I write while following this tutorial, and is intended to be read as part of [this blog](http://blog.confirmedcrit.com).
